            The Full Story
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg md:text-3xl">
            The college since inception has existed as two colleges running
            nursing and midwifery programmes under two different administrations
            namely Nurse&apos;s Training College (NTC) and Midwifery Training
            School (MTS). In 2007, both institutions merged under one
            administration hence the name Nursing and Midwifery Training College
            (NMTC).
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg md:text-3xl">
            The nursing programme was started in 11th January, 1955 with a State
            Registered Nursing (SRN) certificate program which was three year
            duration. In 1968, a two-year Enrolled Nursing (EN) programme was
            introduced which ran alongside the SRN. The SRN certificate
            programme later gave way to a 3-year Comprehensive SRN programme in
            August 1969. In 1983, the Enrolled Nursing programme was phased out.
            A Registered General Nursing (RGN) Diploma programme was introduced
            in 1999 and that is what is currently running.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4 text-lg md:text-3xl">
            The Midwifery programme also started in 1957 with a two year and two
            and a half year duration depending on one&apos;s entry
            qualification. These continued until the early 1980s when it was
            replaced with a one year Post Basic programme after completion of
            SRN. A three year Registered Midwifery (RM) Diploma programme was
            introduced in 2003. These programmes run concurrently till 2007 when
            the certificate was phased out. Currently the college is running a
            3-year Diploma in Registered General Nursing and Registered
            Midwifery.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg line-through md:text-3xl">
            The College also runs a Two-year Post Nurse Assistant Clinician
            /Nurse Assistant Preventive (NAC/NAP) certificate in Midwifery
            programme since September, 2016.
